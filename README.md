#ADSL connector

ADSL is french for "Aide aux dirigeants et services aux licenci√©s". 
It's a web service supplied by ADSL company to tennis club. Thanks to this plateform,
each member of the tennis club can easily booked a tennis court session. For further
information, you can check [official website](https://www.adsltennis.com/).

The main purpose of this project is to create an agent able to connect into the plateform
and booking a tennis court session. I'm a tennis player and i'm using this agent to schedule my tennis sessions 
of the week.

It's an interesting way to discover 'selenium' in Python.
In my case, I'm using 'selenium' instead of 'mechanize' or 'request' because it's best way to
deal with internet browsing. When we use 'webdriver' module to start a session with 'Safari()', 'Firefox()'
or 'Chrome()' and do some requests, a navigator window will pop up and show us what our python script is doing.
